### My background

Born and raised in Northern part of India, lived in a farmhouse with parents where I completed my High School at a private school. My father always wanted me to get higher education in a western country so we planned my move to New Zealand. I spend about four years there completing my Education in Business Managment therefore I moved back to India in 2014 shortly after, got married to my beautiful wife Sonia Goswami, together we migrated to Canada in 2016 to began our new life and fulfill our dreams. We landed in beautiful place called Okanagan Valley in British Columbia in the month of January and experienced our first snow fall. We welcomed our handsome son Rehaan Giri Goswami in 2018.

Moving ahead from my personal story, I am enthusiastic about all things regarding Computers and Networks. I have six years of experience in Information Technology with excellent communication skills.

I am a big advocate for Open Source, I use Linux based Operating Systems, Applications and Softwareâ€™s to home lab or run home network solution like pfSense for firewall, Raspberry Pi (pi-hole OS) for DNS, TureNAS for Network Storage, Open VPN and so on.

Idea to have this blog post, to store the documentations of home labs and journey through it. Once again, I thank you for taking time to be here.
