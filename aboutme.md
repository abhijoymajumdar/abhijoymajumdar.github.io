### About me

The best thing about blogs is that people share what they learn, make tutorials so everyone increase their knowledge in the process. I have always read articles and How-To's be it for my job or not and it helped me a lot. This blog is the opportunity for me to contribute and give back to the community.

I am passionate in new technologies in general but my heart goes to virtualization for which I grew a real interest and is in a way the foundation of every growing IT technologies nowadays. Containers, clouds, SDS, SDN, you name it, 95% chances that there is a hypervisor somewhere in the background. When time allows it I run nested labs to test new features and products for potential implementation in my professional environment... or just to try new cool stuff.

I hope you find what you are after in this blog and learn some stuff along the way, Cheers!
