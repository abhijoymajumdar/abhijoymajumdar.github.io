### About me

The best thing about blogs is that people can share what they learn, speak from experience or write tutorials so everyone increase their knowledge in the process. I have always read articles and How-To's, be it for my job or not, it helped me a lot. This blog is the opportunity for me to contribute and give back to the community. I consider it as being a mere brain dump of my IT journey.

I am passionate about new technologies in general but my heart goes to virtualization for which I grew a real interest and is in a way the foundation of every growing IT technologies nowadays. Containers, clouds, SDS, SDN, you name it, 95% chances that there is a hypervisor somewhere in the background. When time permits I run nested labs on my Dell R430 to test new features and products.

As a day job I work as an IT consultant based in the south of France with a strong focus on infrastructure and virtualization. I work as a freelancer with various clients and projects where I can add value and learn something in the process.

Feel free to hit me up if you need consulting services and I'll be happy to chat.

I also offer technical writing services in which the content is a lot more polished and professional than my own blog.

You can find most of my freelance work on the <a href="https://www.altaro.com/dojo/author/xavier/">Altaro VMware Dojo</a> and <a href="https://www.bdrsuite.com/blog/author/xavier/">bdrsuite's VMware blog</a>.
