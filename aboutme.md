title: About me
---

This is something that I wanted to do for quite a while and I finally took some time aside to get to it: Creating a public space where I can share the interesting things I learn, the problems I encounter and how I solved them. Or even just the new cool techs that I think deserve to be more popular. It is as well a great opportunity for me to dig deeper into the topics I write about and to have a place to store my thoughts (no more .txt file containing that awesome powershell command that I lost when emptying my USB key to make room for Game Of Throne!).

My name is Xavier Avrillier and even though I am french I live in Scotland where I work as technical engineer in a managed services department, so if some of my english doesn't make sense this is why. 
In my previous professional experiences I worked as a Windows administrator for SMBs and as a pre-sales engineer for an IT company for 2 years where I learned a great deal about a wide range of products and technologies. My current position is mainly focused on managing the VMware infrastructure of the company but I assist my colleagues in Windows world as well. I got really interested in Powershell and PowerCLI scripting as well so there will probably be quite a lot of it in this blog.

I hope you'll will find some interesting articles and learn some stuff !
