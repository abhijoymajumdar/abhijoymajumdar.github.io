This is something I wanted to do for quite a while and I finally put some time aside to get to it: Creating a blog where I can share the interesting things I learn in my job, the problems I encounter and how I solved them. Or even just the new cool things that I think deserve to be more popular. It is as well a great opportunity for me to dig deeper into the topics I write about and to have a place to store my thoughts (no more .txt file containing that awesome powershell command that I lost when emptying my USB key to make room for Game Of Throne!).

My name is Xavier Avrillier, I am a frenchman living in Scotland where I work as a technical engineer in a managed services department, so if my english doesn't make sense this is why!
In my previous professional experiences I worked as a Windows administrator for SMBs and as a pre-sales engineer for an IT company for 2 years, where I learned a great deal about a wide range of products and technologies. My current position is mainly focused on managing the VMware infrastructure of the company but I assist my colleagues in Windows world as well. I got really into Powershell and PowerCLI scripting these last few months so there will probably be quite a lot of it in this blog.

I hope you wee chappies will find some interesting articles and learn some stuff !
