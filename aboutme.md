### About me  
The best thing about blogs is that people share what they learn, make tutorial and everyone increase his knowledge in this process. I have always read articles and tutorials as part of my job mainly, and I wanted to participate and share as well. It is a great opportunity for me to dig deeper into the topics I write about and to have a place to centralize the awesome things I stumbled into.

My name is **Xavier Avrillier**, french technical engineer living in Scotland where I work for a british company in the managed services department. My current position is mainly focused on managing the VMware infrastructure of the company as well as assisting my colleagues in Windows world. Working with my “PowerShell guru” colleague got me really into scripting and PowerCLI so there will probably be quite a lot of it in this blog.

I am passionate in new technologies in general but my heart goes to virtualization which I am really interested in and is for me the base of every growing IT technologies today like containers, clouds, SDS, SDN, ...
As well as working in virtualization I study for VMware professional certifications and run labs at home to discover new features, products and possibilities for potential implementation in my professional environment or just for my personal knowledge.

In my previous professional positions I worked as a Windows administrator for SMBs and as a pre-sales engineer, where I learned a great deal about a wide range of products and technologies, which makes me polyvalent and a quick learner. 

I hope you find some interesting articles in this blog and learn some good stuff, Cheers!
