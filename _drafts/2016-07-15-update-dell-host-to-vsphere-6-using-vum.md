title: Update Dell host to vSphere 6 using VUM
---
In this post I will go through the steps involved in the process of updating a Dell server to the latest version of vSphere. I precised Dell because I am going to use a customized Dell ISO to get the latest certified drivers and patches.

Why do I use a Dell customized ISO?

- Ease in drivers a specific packages management.
- Simplify the support calls (If I am using the latest Dell image the support can't use this in case I need them).
- Dell server, Dell software, it makes sense to me.
