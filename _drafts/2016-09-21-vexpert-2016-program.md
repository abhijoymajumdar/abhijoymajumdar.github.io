A couple weeks ago VMware sent over the emails to notify the new and returning **vExperts 2016**, and it is with great pleasure that I received mine!

The vExpert program is an "award" given to the professionals who get involved in the VMware community by sharing their knowledge in blogs, helping others in community forums, acting as evangelists for VMware products, etc. In short, those who put effort to make the big machine work better and help others. There are equivalents in other companies like Cisco champions or Microsoft MVPs for example.

The vExperts are given access to a great range of learning and working tools. It allows us to get early access and test licenses on multiple products which is amazing for labs and certification paths.

You can find the complete list of vExperts 2016 [in this link.](http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2016/08/vexpert-2016-second-half-announcement.html)

This is a great opportunity to be part of this big community to learn and share even more!
