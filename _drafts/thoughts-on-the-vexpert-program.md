A couple days ago a received a call for content communication from the one and only Corey Romero around the vExpert program. While I try to keep my thoughts away from my blog to focus on technical content, I also acknowledged all that the vExpert program brought to me and it wouldn't be right to oblige and write a quick piece about it.

## What is the vExpert program

For those who don't what the vExpert program is, it is a global evangelism and advocacy program that benefits both VMware and the candidate, comparable to Microsoft MVP program. You can become a vExpert if you participate in the community in a number of ways, it could be through blogs, talks, local community events, webinars, VMTN heroes, you name it. 

The point is to give back to the community and participate in the global VMware marketing effort as a whole. The title is delivered on a yearly basis and you need to manually apply to remain a vExpert. 

There are many benefits in being a vExpert which I won't list here but you can find all the details on the [vExpert Application Portal](https://vexpert.vmware.com/).

I got into the vExpert program in 2016 and renewed it every year ever since. I was so chuffed about it that I wrote a [short piece about it](https://www.vxav.fr/2016-09-21-vexpert-2016-program/).
