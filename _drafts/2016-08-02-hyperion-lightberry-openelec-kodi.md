title: Hyperion + Lightberry + OpenElec + Kodi
---
These last few weeks I got more and more interested in home automation and other cool to do with like so I thought I'd deviate from virtualization the time of a tutorial. 

I did this project to create a mood lighting behind the TV that "follows" the colors displayed on the screen and enhance the experience of movie watching. It is pretty much an open source version of Philips' Ambilight except it can work on a wide range of devicew and is much cheaper (with a little bit of hardware and a bit more elbow grease).

The system is made up of 4 main components.  I won't get into the details of the raspberry or the TV as I assume you already have your media center running Kodi.

Here are the different components of the system and what they do.

- **Hyperion** : [Website](https://hyperion-project.org/wiki/Main)

Hyperion is an open source _Ambilight implementation_ under MIT license. It is the software that controls the LEDs according to the colors detected with a clever algorithm. There are other similar projects such as Boblight but I chose Hyperion as it seems to be the most common.

- **Lightberry** : [Website](http://lightberry.eu/)

Lightberry is the hardware bit that acts as an interface between Hyperion and the LED strip. Lightberry offers multiple devices and packs that offer a different level of integration. In this tutorial I am only focusing on the USB converter. There is a version with a GPIO interface as well but I already have a case that closes the top of the raspberry. You could also do without the lightberry part by using the GPIO pins 19 and 23 for clock and data.

This converter alone will only make the LEDs work with the Raspberry PI. If you have other devices that you would like to integrate like a DVD player or a Xbox and such you will need more stuff (I'll cover the other possible scenarios at the end).

- **OpenElec installed on a Raspberry Pi** : [Website](http://openelec.tv/) 

My OpenElec is on version 6.0.3 and runs Kodi 15 on a Raspberry Pi 2, at the time of this article you can get a Raspberry Pi 3 with a better hardware for about £30. 

- **RGB LED strip individually addressable (WS2801)**

They must be individually addressable, meaning you can control the LEDs independently (color, intensity). Each LED is equipped with a micro controller that hyperion must have be compatible with. There are several types but I chose the WS2801. The controller is not always visible like on the APA102, but you can check wether it is independently addressable with the labels on the strip.
- 5V, CK, SI, GND : Independently addressable
- xV, R, G, B : Non Independently addressable

## What you need

- WS2801 LED strips.
- Lightberry USB converter (include the USB cable).

- A power supply
- A soldering iron

You can get the whole lot directly as a kit from lightberry. It costs about 90€ and contains everything you need. [Lightberry HD Kit](https://lightberry.eu/shop/shop/lightberry-hd/)

## Update firmware of the lightberry USB converter



## Install the LEDs

Thanks to the guys of the Hyperion project and lightberry it is super easy to set up.

## Install Hyperion

- First Connect to your OpenElec via SSH using your favorite SSH client (Putty). Default Username/Password are root/openelec.

- Download the Hyperion project script.

```
curl -L --output install_hyperion.sh --get https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tvdzwan/hyperion/master/bin/install_hyperion.sh
```

- Install Hyperion, the raspberry pi will reboot.

```
sh ./install_hyperion.sh
```

Your SSH session should look like this.

## Configure Hyperion

- First download the Hyperion Configurator plugin for Kodi on the [website of lightberry](http://lightberry.eu/).

Scroll all the way down to the downloads and grab the Config generator plugin. It's a tiny zip file of about 44KB.

- Transfer the zip file somewhere OpenElec has access. I used WinSCP to copy the file in the rom.

![zip-winscp.JPG]({{site.baseurl}}/img/zip-winscp.JPG)

- Go back to Kodi > Add on > Install from zip file

![Install-from-zip.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/img/Install-from-zip.jpg)

- browse to the location of the zip file

![select-hyperion-plugin.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/img/select-hyperion-plugin.jpg)

- Select the zip file containing the Hyperion plugin and check that it installs correctly
