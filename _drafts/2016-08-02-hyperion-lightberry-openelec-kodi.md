These last few weeks I got more and more interested in home automation and other cool thing like LEDs so I thought I'd deviate from virtualization the time of a tutorial. 

I did this project to create a mood lighting behind the TV that "follows" the colors displayed on the screen and enhance the experience of movie watching. It is pretty much the same thing as Philips' Ambilight except it can work on a wide range of device and is much cheaper (with a little bit of hardware and a bit more elbow grease).
