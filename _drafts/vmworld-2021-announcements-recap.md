VMworld 2021 took place on 5/6/7 of October 2021 during which VMware officials unveiled a number of new offerings, products, features etc... As always it was a great show with lots of value and you could really tell where VMware is taking the world of IT infrastructure.

VMworld 2021 was the first event since Raghu Raghuram started as VMware's CEO this year.

We can tell that VMware understood that cloud adoption isn't easy for all organizations as they keep simplifying the process to get there. They also understood that on-premise isn't going anywhere so they are bringing the cloud to vSphere with the likes of Project Arctic. VMware Tanzu was the other golden child of this year's VMworld 2021 announcements with many sessions on the topic and some exciting announcements.

Without further ado, let's dig in!

## VMware Cloud

### VMware Cross-Cloud services

This VMworld 2021 announcement was among the main ones as it aims at simplifying the adoption of multi-cloud for VMware customers. The goal is to be able to pick and choose from five services among several cloud providers in a flexbiel and "free" way.

* Security and networking.
