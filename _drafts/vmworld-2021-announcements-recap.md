VMworld 2021 took place on 5/6/7 of October 2021 during which VMware officials unveiled a number of new offerings, products, features etc... As always it was a great show with lots of value and you could really tell where VMware is taking the world of IT infrastructure. 

This year's VMworld 2021 announcements were spearheaded by multi-cloud and modern apps. We can tell that VMware understood that cloud adoption isn't easy for all organizations as they keep simplifying the process to get there. They also understood that on-premise isn't going anywhere so they are bringing the cloud to vSphere with the likes of Project Arctic. VMware Tanzu was the other golden child of this year's VMworld 2021 with many sessions on the topic and some exciting announcements.
