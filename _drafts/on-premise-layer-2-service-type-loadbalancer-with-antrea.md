While kubernetes clusters running with cloud providers benefit from external load balancers which can be easily interacted with through the CPI, on-premise installations don't get that by default. Sure if you have an external load balancer you can always install the kubernetes operator if there is one but it is not such a straightforward operation. For instance, if you take clusters deployed to vSphere through [CAPV ](https://www.vxav.fr/2021-11-21-understanding-kubernetes-cluster-api-provider-vsphere-capv/)of TCE, your LoadBalancer service resources will remain in pending state out of the box.

    ‚ùØ k get svc whoami-lb
    NAME        TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
    whoami-lb   LoadBalancer   10.102.27.166   <pending>     8080:30001/TCP   17s

There are a few options out there to get Load Balancer capabilities such as metalLB but I liked the idea of having it included in the CNI with Antrea. There are several ways to achieve load balancing but in this blog I am simply demonstrating how to get started with a pool of external IPs like metalLB.

First and foremost, the documentation about this is in the [Antrea repo ](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/blob/main/docs/service-loadbalancer.md)and you will find everything that is missing in my blog there.

Install Antrea v1.5.0

    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/releases/download/v1.5.0/antrea.yml
