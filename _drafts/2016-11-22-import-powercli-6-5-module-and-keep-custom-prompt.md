title: Import PowerCLI 6.5 module and keep custom prompt
---
My Powershell profile has a few different things including:
- A function to add the VMware core snapin and connect quickly to a vCenter.
- A function to customize the prompt with separator and display of the connected vCenter.

These are very usefull to have as I spend quite a lot of time on PowerShell to make things quicker and clearer.

When I upgraded to [PowerCLI 6.5 R1](http://blogs.vmware.com/PowerCLI/2016/11/new-release-powercli-6-5-r1.html) I noticed that the connection to vCenter failed with the error ```The Windows PowerShell snap-in 'VMware.VimAutomation.Core' is not installed on this computer.```.

After investigation it appears that the snapins can't be used anymore for PowerCLI. Now we have to use the modules (which is the proper way to do). 

- **NO :** ```Add-PSSnapin VMware.VimAutomation.Core```
- **YES:** ```Import-Module VMware.VimAutomation.Core```

However I ran into a problem when I imported the module. My prompt was reset/modified by it, which is really annoying.

I used to add the VMware snapin in my Connect-vCenter function to add it only if I need it. The problem with that module is that the custom prompt is loaded at the start of PowerShell, so when you Import the module afterwards it overrides your custom prompt as seen in the previous screenshot.

In order to fix this issue, the idea is to Import the module in your PowerShell profile everytime before the prompt. 

The start time of powershell is a little bit slower but the advantage is that you keep your custom profile and the module is already ready to use. I actually timed the start of powershell with and without the module imported and the difference is under a second so something I can live with.
