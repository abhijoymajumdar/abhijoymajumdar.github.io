title: Add commands to PowerCLI with that SSH module

Lately I was in the process of hardening the security of my hosts for SSH. As much as I can and if I'm not in a hurry I try to do with PowerShell what I could do with the GUI to learn, but I can never remember the commands that I don't use to often. The fact that I don't configure SSH every day on my hosts is quite obvious but I thought it could be useful to have a library of cmdlets allowing me to query this service as there are no built in ones at the time of this article.
