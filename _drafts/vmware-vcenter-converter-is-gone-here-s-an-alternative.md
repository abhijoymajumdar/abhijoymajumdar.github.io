vCenter Converter has been a trusty sidekick to many IT administrators over the years, helping them achieve the virtualization of tricky physical workloads. While it is always recommended to deploy a new clean virtual machine, it isn't always possible due to licensing or compatibility constraints with legacy software for instance.

As you may have read recently, [VMware removed vCenter Converter ](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2022/02/vcenter-converter-unavailable-for-download.html)from the available downloads. This was a precautionary measure to prevent users from downloading a product that hasn't been updated since 2019 and open the door to all kinds of vulnerabilities. If you still need a P2V tool and don't want to use a deprecated product, [Nakivo ](https://www.nakivo.com/physical-to-virtual-recovery/)can help you there.

### Nakivo P2V: Physical-to-Virtual Recovery

As you probably know Nakivo distributes and Backup and Replication software that supports physical, virtual and cloud workloads with a plethora of bells and whistles to cover as many data protection scenarios as possible. 

One of these bells (or whistles) is the "P2V: Physical-to-Virtual Recovery". You guessed it, this feature offers several physical to virtual capabilities and is superior to vCenter Converter in a number of ways.  

With P2V Recovery in NAKIVO Backup & Replication, you can restore your Windows and Linux physical servers and workstations from backups to VMware VMs. Use Instant P2V to run your physical workloads in a VMware environment without any downtime or to test updates before applying them to your production environment. Use Full P2V Recovery to virtualize your infrastructure and perform safe and seamless physical-to-virtual migrations.

### Conclusion

What I like about Nakivo P2V: Physical-to-Virtual Recovery is that you can use it in a number of ways that best suit your needs.
