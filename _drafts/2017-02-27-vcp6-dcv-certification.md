title: VCP6-DCV certification
---
After months of studying (some more than others) and running labs, I finally commited to the VCP exam and passed it succesfully.

> This industry-recognized certification validates that you know how to administer and troubleshoot vSphere V6 infrastructures, leveraging best practices to provide a scalable and reliable virtualization platform for your company. - VMware

It's been quite a journey to get there:

-Studying/Labing at home
-Going on a 5 days intensive VMWare course
-Studying/Labing at home
-Taking the vSphere Foundation exam
-Studying/Labing at home
-And finally taking the VCP exam

But eventually it was totally worth it! lot's learned in the process and it's a good confidence boost to see that it all paid off in the end.
