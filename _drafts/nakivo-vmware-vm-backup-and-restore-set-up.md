### Deployment types

### Main features

### Editions and Pricing

#### Free Edition

Nakivo Backup and Replication offer a free version which includes licenses for 10 workloads and 5 Microsoft Office 365 accounts. However it is said to be completely free for one year so I assume this is a time restriction.

#### Free trial

If the free edition isn't going to cut it for you, you can start with a [15-day free trial ](https://www.nakivo.com/resources/download/trial-download/)which includes the following features on top of what the free edition offers:

* **Site Recovery** – Advanced DR workflows to recover workloads.

#### Pricing

Nakivo Backup and Replication offers several levels of licensing which vary according to the features set, environment size and type of support required. 

**Per-Socket (CPU) licenses are perpetual** and let you backup as many VMs as you want and a number of physical target as well.

The **per-workload subscription lets you tailor** the number of virtual machines, physical server and AWS EC2 instances to backup. Note that the Basic edition isn't available with this pricing model.

The best way for you to get a good grasp of the licensing options available is to have a look at the [pricing calculator](https://www.nakivo.com/how-to-buy/pricing_calculator/). Adjust the sliders and values to tailor the license to your needs and get an idea of how much it would be. That way you can compare both license types and calculate your ROI to find out which one makes the most sense to your organization.
