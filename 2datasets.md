<h4>Datasets used</h4>
Why did we use more than one dataset?

The starting question was: can we observe a correlation trend between violence in the real world and violence in the film world? If so, is this correlation positive or negative? Clearly, in order to answer such questions, it is first necessary to define trends of violence on one side and on the other side: in the real world and in cinematic representations. <br/>
For this, it was necessary to introduce two additional datasets: Kaggle movie dataset and FBI dataset. <br/>
The first, was used to reinforce and fill in the missing CMU data. While the second was clearly used to define the trend of violence in the real world. Immediately a question arises: why FBI? Indeed, the world of violence is not confined to the United States. The answer is twofold and comes from two directionally distinct considerations: on the one hand, for the final model, it was necessary to find a dataset providing data on crimes committed on a weekly basis. FBI provides such information, with the necessary detail. On the other hand, we quickly concluded that American films represented the majority of the films produced. They therefore represent a sufficiently large sample that would also allow us to determine whether real-world violence influences film production. <br/>
