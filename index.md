### Education
A millennial, born and brought up in suburban Delhi, I did my initial schooling under the CBSE board. Following this, I did my graduation in the **Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT)** from [IGNOU, Delhi](https://www.ignou.ac.in/).

### Work
[DXC (Earstwhile CSC India)](https://dxc.com/in/en) blessed me with the first ever opportunity to explore my skills as a technical professional. This further opened the doors towards tech giants such as [Tech Mahindra](https://www.techmahindra.com/) and my current organization [HCL Tech](https://www.hcltech.com/). I completed my **Master in Computer Application** while still employed with CSC.

### Technology Engagements
I have been primarily working on the Infrastructure side of enterprise IT, providing consulting services on database design, deployment, redundancy, replication, high availability, corporate compliance, ensuring more than 99.96% DB uptime.

My core skills involve designing, planning and executing several database migrations and upgrades with minimal downtime. However, alongside of this primary skillset, I've also been acutely interested in automation and coding. I have worked on Python, LaTex, Markdown, Git and shell. In databases, I've worked on Oracle, MariaDB, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.

### Personal Interests
Acquainting myself with the latest in the fitness realm and flipping through the gems of the literary world.
