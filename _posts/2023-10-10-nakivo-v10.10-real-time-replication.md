Here I am announcing Nakivo v10.10 on the 10/10, how about that! In an era where data is more valuable than just about anything, this new version brings significant change to its capabilities when it comes to Recovery Point Objective (RPO) with claims of near-zero data loss and downtime. Bringing you ever closer to business continuity.

Whether you're a tech enthusiast, a business owner, or simply a customer who values their data, read on  to find out what you will get out of this new release. 

As usual, you can download **Nakivo Backup & Replication v10.10** with a 15-day free trial.

## Real-Time Replication

With Nakivo v10.10, you can perform real-time replication for VMware vSphere hosts with Real-Time-Replication jobs (RTR). While the feature is currently in Beta phase, real-time replication jobs continuously copy data from the source VM as it is being generated.

The feature is based on the I/O Filter module that must be installed on the source host which allows intercepting and manipulating VM's I/O to support real-time replication. The I/O Filter bundle can be downloaded from the NAKIVO Backup & Replication UI, added to vCenter using the mob and configured on the vSphere hosts with a VM storage policy.

To protect a VM in real time, you can then apply the VM storage policy to said VM.

Change tracking is handled by the Journal Service, a software module to install on the target transporter which manages the I/O Journal created for each VM disk. It then sets of records of I/O operations that keeps reference recovery points.

The Journal Service installer can also be downloaded from the NAKIVO Backup & Replication UI to then be installed on the virtual appliance deployed on the needed ESXi host.

As a result, you can achieve a recovery point objective as low as 1 second to almost eliminate data loss thanks to quick fail over capability.

## Other changes

On another note, Nakivo v10.10 also introduces a simplified installation procedure of physical machine manual agent packages.

Also note that, starting with NAKIVO Backup & Replication v10.11, Nutanix Acropolis v5.x will no longer be tested as it is end of life. In which case you really should be upgrading your underlying infrastructure.

## Wrap up

With Nakivo Backup & Replication v10.10, the company focuses on reducing the amount of acceptable data loss by allowing for stricter RPO for new levels of resilience and high availability.

As usual, updating to Nakivo v10.9 is as easy as it gets and you can find all the details you need in the [documentation](https://helpcenter.nakivo.com/User-Guide/Content/Deployment/Updating-NAKIVO-Backup-and-Replication/Updating-NAKIVO-Backup-and-Replication.htm).
