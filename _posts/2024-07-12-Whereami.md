Hello Again, I am currenly working at a ISP for their Network Operations Center. It has been close to two years at this role. Although there is a lot of different technology we use however, the day to day activities are involved into reviewing device logs, service port and coordination work amount different teams such as Core Data Network, Broadband, Different ISP's and such. As far as my career goal I am keen to enter into Enterprise Networking. I have set my goal to learn Enterprise Networking technology through self-learning, and I have choosen Cisco's Curriculam for an associate level exam (Cisco Certified Network Associate).

I usually spend at least an hour either studing OCG book for CCNA or lab using either packet tracer or GNS on a work day, I am spending 4-5 hours to prepare for CCNA exam during off rotation from work.

Soon I will update you with another blog until then keep studying.
