## Have you heard of "adding a duck"?

*Adding a duck* comes from a 90s game developer working on an animated chess game, and knowing their manager will always request some change just to show they're adding value to the process (whether consciously or subconsciously) - so the developer added a duck companion to the queen piece - whatever the queen was doing, the duck would be flapping around too.

Sure enough when the work was complete, the manager's feedback was "Looks great - just one thing, get rid of the duck!"
