This website is my first-time project to work on a web development. At first it seemed like a daunting task when I was not sure _config.yml is the key play here and what .md format is all about. But trust me some dedication and commitment can take you long way. So, it did for me thus I am here writing my first ever blog on first ever website using web development tool.

A full credit goes to Github. I have used a simple theme Beautiful Jekyll on for this website but it has a vast number of features for me to explore. I will be writing blogs on weekly-basis to demonstrate the skills and organize a quality documentations section to store reference database.

See you for now.
