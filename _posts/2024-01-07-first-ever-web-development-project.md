Hello World! This is my first ever Web Development project to create a website. I guess i can now check off one of the goal (to create A blogpost website) of 2024. At first it seemed like a daunting task to know where to began but utilizing Google and Youtube I quickly learnet what is needed and what should be the end results of this website. My Idea was to have a simple website with options to create pages using navigation bar. Trust me dedication and commitment can take you long way. So, it did for me thus I am here writing my first ever blog on first ever website.

A full credit goes to Github. I have used a simple theme called Beautiful Jekyll for this website. It has a vast number of features which I will be exploring. I will be writing blogs on weekly-basis to demonstrate the progess and organize a quality documentations section.

Will meet you in next blog.
