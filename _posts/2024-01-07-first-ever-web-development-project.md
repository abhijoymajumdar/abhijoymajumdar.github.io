This website is my first-time project to work on a web development. At first it seemed like a daunting task when I was not sure what is _config.yml and how it plays a key role and what .md format is all about. But trust me some dedication and commitment can take you long way. So, it did for me thus I am here writing my first ever blog on first ever website using.

A full credit goes to Github. I have used a simple theme called Beautiful Jekyll for this website. It has a vast number of features which I will be exploring. I will be writing blogs on weekly-basis to demonstrate the skills and organize a quality documentations section.

See you later for now.
