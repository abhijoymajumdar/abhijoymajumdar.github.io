- **[url-shortening](https://github.com/shafi-/url-shortening)**

## Results

- **[url-shortening](https://github.com/shafi-/url-shortening)**

## Strategy
- Start with the endpoints or clients. This helps to think like the end user and overcome the problem of being too technically blind.
- Think about the real domain
- Think where you need to scale up and where not.
- Think about the best way to scale up and where to scale down.
- Caching strategy. Why are you choosing a certain cache invalidation strategy
- What is the best way to handle concurrency
- What is the best suited way of storing data? Think about the read and write concerns? Do you need ACID?
