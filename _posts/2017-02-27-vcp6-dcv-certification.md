title: VCP6-DCV certification
---
After months of studying (some more than others) and running labs, I finally commited to the VCP exam and passed it succesfully.

> This industry-recognized certification validates that you know how to administer and troubleshoot vSphere V6 infrastructures, leveraging best practices to provide a scalable and reliable virtualization platform for your company. - VMware

It's been quite a journey to get there:

- Studying/Labing at home
- Going on a 5 days intensive VMWare course
- Taking the vSphere Foundation exam
- And finally taking the VCP exam

But eventually it was totally worth it! lot's learned in the process and it's a good confidence boost to see that it all paid off in the end.

Here is a list of the main resources I've used to prepare:

- [Mastering VMware vSphere 6](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mastering-VMware-vSphere-Nick-Marshall-x/dp/1118925157) by Nick Marshall.
- [Vladan's guide](https://www.vladan.fr/vcp6-dcv/) gives a good summary of the knowledge requirements for the exam.
- [VMware VCP blueprint.](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=64180&ui=www_cert)
- [PluralSight](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiFxtXm3b_SAhXrCsAKHbfTAlkQFggcMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2F&usg=AFQjCNFLP2LFrnKDWAl0FEnHLfjcdv184Q&sig2=54Lq_sxocd1TOwTKwuO27w) video courses.
-The multiple VMware guides.

I ran all my labs nested in VMware workstation (VirtualBox would also do just fine).

Good luck to those looking to take the exam. And as painful as it is, try to enjoy the learning along the way :)
