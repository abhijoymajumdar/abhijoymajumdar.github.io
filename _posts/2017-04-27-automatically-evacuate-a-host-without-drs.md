title: Automatically evacuate a host without DRS
date: '2017-04-27'
---
Like many other places I believe, our non-prod hosts run on vSphere Standard instead of Enterprise Plus for its lower price. The price is great, but what isn't is that DRS isn't available. Which means every time a host needs to be put in maintenance mode you have to do it the old school way: _manually vmotion all the VMs running on it_.

My non-prod cluster has 9 hosts and 300 VMs. Although an option, the manual vMotion way is incredibly boring and time consuming.

In this post I am going to share a Powershell script that I quickly put together to automate the process of safely evacuating a host from the VMs running on it. 

This script will safely migrate the VMs of a host one by one to other hosts by taking into consideration:

- Projected maximum CPU usage after migration (default 75%).
- Projected maximum Memory usage after migration (default 75%).
- Projected maximum vCPU per physical cores after migration (default 9).
- Possibility to exclude hosts from the possible destinations.
- Possibility to exclude VMs from the migratees.
- Interactive mode with possibility to change the selected destination host (default) or skip a VM.
- Fully automated mode.
- Possibility to use whatif.

If the resources requirements can't be fulfilled, a warning is displayed and the VM is skipped.

The execution is pretty slow so I it's something that can be improved. I don't really mind as I fire it up and then I go do something else while it's doing my job. 

We could imagine adding a command to place the host in maintenance mode at the end of the script, but for now I don't mind a right click.

## Usage examples

**Evacuate a host automatically with the default values (see above).**

All the live VMs on ESXi-1 will be migrated to other hosts as long as they don't go over 75% CPU/MEM usage and a 9:1 vCPU ratio.

```powershell
Evacuate-VMHost -VMHost (Get-vmhost ESXi-1) -fullyautomated
```

**Evacuate a host interactively with the defined values.**

For every VM a choice will be given to the user including the projected capacity after the migration for every available host with a recommended one.

The user has 2 choices:

- Press enter and follow the script's recommendation (the host with a *)
- Select another destination host
- Skip the VM and leave it where it is

```powershell
Evacuate-VMHost -VMHost (Get-vmhost ESXi-1) -VMHostMaxCPUUsagePercent 80 -VMHostMaxMEMUsagePercent 85 -VMHostMaxVCpuPerCore 10
```

## Parameters

- **VMHost**: Host to evacuate
- **VMHostMaxCPUUsagePercent**: CPU usage (%) limit that the destination hosts shouldn't reach
- **VMHostMaxMEMUsagePercent**: Memory usage (%) limit that the destination hosts shouldn't reach
- **VMHostMaxVCpuPerCore**: vCPU:core ration that the destination hosts shouldn't reach
- **ExcludedVMHost**: Hosts to exclude from the possible destinations
- **ExcludedVM**: Virtual machines that won't be migrated
- **fullyAutomated**: No choice given to the user, the VMs are migrated automatically one by one
- **Whatif**: Simulate the migration but doesn't do it
