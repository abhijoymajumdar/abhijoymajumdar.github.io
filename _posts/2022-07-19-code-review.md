## Practices that can make your code review efficient and helpful for your team

- Review the problem it wanted to solve is solved
- Review if the solution is good enough
- Review code quality - naming, modularity, SOLID-compatibility
- Review if there is enough tests
- Suggest if there is any point to suggest
- Do not block PR unless there is something must to change
- PR can be approved even when you have improvement suggestion that are not critical
- Author is fully authorised to accept or reject improvement suggestions, alternative approach
- Never comment as like you are commanding
- And never ever take comments personally (You might find it very hard at the beginning)

How do you and your team doing code review? Any other helpful practices you can share with others?
