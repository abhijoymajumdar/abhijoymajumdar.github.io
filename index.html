    Violence, according to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.undrr.org/understanding-disaster-risk/terminology/hips/so0006#:~:text=Violence%20refers%20to%20the%20intentional,a%20community%2C%20or%20a%20government.">UUDR</a>, 
    refers to the intentional or unintentional use of force whether physical or psychological, threatened or actual, against an individual, oneself, or against a group of people, a community, or a government. <br/>
    We all have a feeling about what violence is. Everyday violence seems to be on the rise worldwide, as a study on the perception of violence in one's own neighborhood states. <br/>
    In parallel, a lot of movies depict violence. The impact of seen such fictional violence is a <a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10262287/#:~:text=The%20results%20demonstrate%20that%20the,reduces%20behavioral%20inhibition%20in%20adolescents.

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">How do real word violence and movies violence influence each other ? </h1>
    Is there a significant (positive or negative) correlation between the prevalence of violent movies and reported violent crimes in the US? Can we identify periods of abnormally many releases of violent movies?
Can we identify genres that are particularly violent? Do violent movies increase real-world violence, or do they serve as a release that reduces it? Catharsis or Crocodile tears ? 
</p><p>
    This study will focus on United state of America, relating violent events within each states to the release of violent movies in the area.

<p class="oldBox">
  Crocodile tears. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile_tears
  insincere display of emotion, such as a hypocrite crying fake tears of grief. The phrase derives from an ancient belief that crocodiles shed tears while consuming their prey. 
 Funfact
 Actually, crocodile produce tears to hydrate there eyes, this is not linked to emotion and can be triggered by feeding !

<h1 style="text-align: center">The data journey</h1>

<p>
Data cleaning, origin and exploration are developed in the dataset page. 
Similarly all the models and methods implemented are explained in the models and methods page. 
Here, we will focus on the workflow, visualization and findings.

To be able to correlate real life violence and movies violences, we first have to quantify violence on both side. <br/>
Our data journey will begin with the study of violence in movies starting from the CMU movie dataset. <br/>
Secondly, we will analysis the national incident-based reporting system of the FBI to construct a violence score for each states of america.<br/>
Finally, we will asses the correlation between the two metrics using an auto-regressive distributed lack model.

<h2>Movie violence classification</h2>

<p>
The central dataset for our study is the CMU Dataset. Since time will play a crucial role in our study and precise release dates are often unavailable, missing dates were filled using The Movies Dataset from Kaggle.

<h4>Violence subjectivity</h4>
<p>
  For our purpose, we need to classify american movies in different level of violence, using only the plots. 
But how can we quantify violence ? What we consider violent or not is highly subjective. 
</p>
<p>
  After data cleaning, we conducted a pilot survey to manually classify a group of movies between 3 categories :
  <ul>
    <li>Violent</li>
    <li>Mildly violent</li>
    <li>Non-violent</li>
  </ul>
 Movies have been classified multiple times to compare the result between different individuals.

 We conclude that a clear definition of violence will be crucial to classify the data. 
 We engineered a prompt with a clear classification task, the definition of each level of violence and examples. We classified between the 3 levels and between 2 levels : violent and non-violent.

<h4>Movie violence classification</h4>
To classify the data, We used the large language model Chat-GPT-4o mini.
